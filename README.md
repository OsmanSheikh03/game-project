# First-Year Game Project
This is a simple browser-based game developed in my first year of university using **p5.js**, a JavaScript library for creative coding. The game runs in the browser and demonstrates basic principles of game development, including animation, user interaction, and collision handling.

## Features
- Real-time canvas rendering using **p5.js**
- Player interaction via keyboard/mouse
- Basic game loop logic (e.g., start, play, reset)
- Scoring system and visual feedback

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- JavaScript (ES6)
- [p5.js](https://p5js.org/)

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
3. Play the game and have fun!

No installations or dependencies are required â€” just a browser!

## File Structure.
index.html       # Entry point to the game
sketch.js        # Main game logic (written in p5.js)
p5.min.js        # p5.js library (minified)

## What I Learned
Fundamentals of object-oriented JavaScript
Creating visual feedback with canvas
Handling real-time input and game state logic
Structuring interactive projects in HTML/JS
